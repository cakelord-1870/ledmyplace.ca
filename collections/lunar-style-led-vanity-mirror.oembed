It saves time for manually cleaning the mirror. The Defogger is not controlled through the switch on the mirror. The switch only controls the LED Light on the mirror to turn on and off or to change CCT. If you wish to switch the defogger off, you will have to turn the switch off or take the plug off of the outlet. The temperature of the defogger will always be 59-68 degrees more than the room temperature. To elaborate, let’s say if your room temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit then the temperature of the defogger would be 86-95 degrees Fahrenheit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"LEDMyplace Canada","offers":[{"title":"24 X 32 Inch","offer_id":31621624332377,"sku":"IVA-JAS1013-2436","price":718.0,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true},{"title":"24 X 36 Inch","offer_id":31621624299609,"sku":"IVA-JAS1012-2432","price":664.1,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true},{"title":"36 X 48 Inch","offer_id":31621624365145,"sku":"IVA-JAS1014-3648","price":826.5,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2242\/2739\/products\/oval_led_bathroom_mirror_24x32_1024x1024_2x_90191eab-4b6b-4844-b1de-ad389524a1c6.jpg?v=1619553979"}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2242\/2739\/collections\/LUNAR_1.png?v=1620156297","url":"https:\/\/ledmyplace.ca\/collections\/lunar-style-led-vanity-mirror.oembed","provider":"LEDMyplace Canada","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
